What is a Tenzies game?
A game wherein there are 10 dice in hands looking with the numbers in all dice to be the same.

The objective in the Tenzies game is to be the first player to get all ten of your dice to show the same number. The first player to get all ten of their dice to match (ten 3’s, for example) shouts out “TENZI” and wins the game!
